    address: 0x20
  - id: mcp2
    address: 0x21
```

## Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Required**, string) - ID to use. It's internal usage only, but you need to define it so you can define output pins properly.

- **init_sleep** (_Optional_, timeperiod, default: 0s) - how long to wait for MCP23017 to respond. Some MCP23017 has delay during initializing. This option will wait for X second for device to respond.
