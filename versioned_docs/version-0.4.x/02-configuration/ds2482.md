# DS2482 I2C One Wire Bus

![DS2482](/img/ds2482.png)

DS2482 is I2C <-> 1-wire bus, so boneIO can read temperature from DS18B20 sensors.

**You need to know I2C address of device you want to connect to!**

Most common address is set up to 0x18.
For first setup turn on debug logging for app or at least for module `boneio.helper.loader`.
DS2482 will scan for all available devices connected to it. You will see logs like:

```bash
2022-04-13 11:14:22 DEBUG (MainThread) [boneio.helper.loader] Found device with address 0x6e0300a279d76428
```

## Example config

```yaml title="Example config"
ds2482:
  id: ds2482
  address: 0x18
```

## Configuration variables:

- **id** (**Reguired**, string) - ID to use in Dallas section declaration.
- **address** (_Optional_, string, default: 0x18) - I2C address of the device
