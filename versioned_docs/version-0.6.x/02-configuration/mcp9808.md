# MCP9808 temp sensor

![MCP9808](/img/mcp9808.jpg)

One of temperature sensors used in relay boards.
You can have the other one mounted, so first check what hardware you have!
Only one MCP9808 is supported right now.

**You need to know I2C address of device you want to connect to!**

## Example config

```yaml title="Example config"
mcp9808:
  - id: temp
    address: 0x18
    update_interval: 60s
    filters:
      - round: 2
      - offset: 5
```

## Configuration variables:

- **id** (_Optional_, string, default: Address of I2C device) - uniquely identifies this device in MQTT and Home Assistant
- **address** (**Required**, string) - I2C address of the device
- **update_interval** (_Optional_, timeperiod, default: 60 seconds) - how often this sensor should update
- **unit_of_measurement** (_Optional_, string, default: `Â°C`) - unit of measurement of the sensor. This does not make any math to switch between units!
- **filters** (_Optional_, list, default: `- round: 2`) - filter list. See [Filters](filters) to learn more.
